Here I gather some notes about security related topics that I find interesting or useful.

## CTF's

- [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org)
- [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com)

## Tools I used so far

- curl -> great for modifying headers, cookies and other input
- ltrace

## Things I learned from CTF's

- Always read the man pages carefully, most of the time the answer is there
