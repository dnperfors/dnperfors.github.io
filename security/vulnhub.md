Recently I found [vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com) and started looking into doing some of the challenges on there. Since I didn't know how these CTF challenges work, I started with reading how others did it by looking into the walkthroughs of [Mr. Robot](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) and some others. With that information I started to do Mr. Robot by myself.

The following pages describe how I attempt to tackle CTF's. It probably isn't the best (or even the right) way, but it does seem to work for me.
