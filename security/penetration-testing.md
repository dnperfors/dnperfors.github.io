On this page I keep my notes about how I perform penetration testing. The information on these pages will evolve during my process of learning more about penetration testing.

## How to learn penetration testing

Some resources I found useful while learning penetration testing:

* [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org)
* [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com)
* [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.eu)

## Kali Linux

Kali linux is my distribution of choice when it comes to penetration testing. There are several options to setup the box:

* using a [premade box](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/), I had some limitations, possibly due to the fact that the guest additions weren't correctly installed.
* using [vagrant files](https://www.kali.org/news/announcing-kali-for-vagrant/)

This Vagrant option I am currently trying. It greatly appeals to me, because of the easy of sharing box definitions and the ease of modification.

## My workflow

The following pages describe how I attempt to tackle CTF's and machines from Hack The Box. It probably isn't the best (or even the right) way, but it does seem to work for me.

* [Reverse Shells](/security/reverseshells)
