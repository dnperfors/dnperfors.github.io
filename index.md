# Welcome to my technical journal.

In this journal I describe my views on software development. All kind of topics could come up, but at the moment I expect to write articles about reviewing source code, writing readable and maintainable code.

## Notes

Here are some notes about what tools I use:

- [Windows develop](/windowsdevelop)
- [Security](/security/security)
- [Vulnhub](/security/vulnhub)

## Development

- [Rolsyn versions](/roslynversions)

## Home automation

Sometimes I do some little things with Home automation:

- [Controlling kaku switches](/homeautomation/kakuswitches)
- [Settingup Home Assistant](/homeautomation/settingup-home-assistant)
